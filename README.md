Hello and welcome to my Maze game.

In order to play, run Core.py as it will open in your terminal.

The notes file shows a couple of notes an ideas I have/had for the game.
t.py is a testing file.
The Algorithm file shows an explanation for how the algorithm works for making the maze.

This used to be a snake game that was later changed to a maze game,
    and you can see those scrapped files in the Scrapped folder.

Thank you and have fun!
