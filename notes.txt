For refresher: ||
- Create a new list that is similar to the ScreenValues
- If new list is different than ScreenValues (if a change happened in ScreenValues)
-> Clear console with os.system('cls') and reprint ScreenValues (recall ScreenPrinter)

Note: U won't need to import time since u will change the velocity of the movement of the snake not by -->
the refresh rate increase, but rather, by changing the time it takes for the snake head to change -->
its position, that is, move forward to the direction of its motion.

- Do remember to add 'cls' to refresher ||
- add the formula for movement for upwards (w) and downwards (s). ||
- add a limiter so that if the user presses w when on the top of the screen, he won't go to the bottom (the same for asd (the rest of movement)). |
- add a raw input for Screen.
- have the head turn into v^<> when near an apple.
- add apples
- Do use a paper and a pen when doing these ideas (do sudo code first).
