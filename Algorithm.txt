This is how the algorithm in Maze_Maker() works:
1. While there are X's in the grid:
    1. # Given an initial position, see where are the X's.
    2. flip a coin and connect to that specific X making it a dot.
    3. Make next position the position of the new dot and repeat 1 and 2 until there are no more dots.
    4. if no more dots, search the grid for an X from top right to bottom left for an X that has an X in one of its sides, and a dot in another.
    5. repeat 1,2,3,4 until there are no more X's on the grid which will end the while statement.
2. If the point is block (the end point being bottom, left point on grid), flip a coin and make it a dot.

note:
- dots are connected points on the grid.
- X's are non connected points on the grid.
